The same method is used when\n * a media node is used as the target for a connection, but in that case an input port is looked\n * up via the input property.\n *\n * Because the input and output property lookups are recursive, it is easy to create simple container\n * nodes that have a number of internal media nodes, and then expose input and output ports as\n * properties.\n *\n * As an example, we might have `cameraSource` and `blurFilter`, which both inherit from\n * {@link MediaNode}. The source has one output port, while the filter has one input and one ouput.\n * We can connect these two together using `cameraSource.output.connect(blurFilter.input)`. This is\n * a bit verbose, but because the connect method will look up the input and output properties, we\n * can just use `cameraSource.connect(blurFilter)` instead. The connect method is made available\n * to the camera source class using {@link MediaSource.connectMixin}.\n *\n * Let's say we now want to create a `BlurredCameraSource` class, which reuses the nodes from the\n * above example. The ES6 class declaration would be\n * `class BlurredCameraSource extends MediaSource.connectMixin()`. The mixin adds the connect and\n * disconnect methods for convenience. In the constructor, we can now create our camera source and\n * blur filter, connect them together, and simply expose the ouput property of the `blurFilter`\n * using `this.output = blurFilter.output`. Since the output lookup is recursive, we can call the\n * connect method of our `blurredCameraSource` directly, but the output port of the blurFilter will\n * in the end be what is actually connected.\n *\n * @class MediaNode\n */\nexport default class MediaNode {\n  constructor() {\n    this[inputs] = new Set()\n    this[outputs] = new Set()\n  }\n\n  toString() {\n    let name = this.constructor.name\n    let camelName\n    if (!name) {\n      camelName = '_mediaNode'\n    } else {\n      camelName = name[0].toLowerCase() + name.slice(1)\n    }\n\n    return `${camelName}{io=${this[inputs].size}/${this[outputs].size}}`\n  }\n\n  // Public methods\n\n  /**\n   * Connect two media nodes or ports together.
