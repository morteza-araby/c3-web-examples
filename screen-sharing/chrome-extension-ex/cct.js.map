The same method is used when\n * a media node is used as the target for a connection, but in that case an input port is looked\n * up via the input property.\n *\n * Because the input and output property lookups are recursive, it is easy to create simple container\n * nodes that have a number of internal media nodes, and then expose input and output ports as\n * properties.\n *\n * As an example, we might have `cameraSource` and `blurFilter`, which both inherit from\n * {@link MediaNode}. The source has one output port, while the filter has one input and one ouput.\n * We can connect these two together using `cameraSource.output.connect(blurFilter.input)`. This is\n * a bit verbose, but because the connect method will look up the input and output properties, we\n * can just use `cameraSource.connect(blurFilter)` instead. The connect method is made available\n * to the camera source class using {@link MediaSource.connectMixin}.\n *\n * Let's say we now want to create a `BlurredCameraSource` class, which reuses the nodes from the\n * above example. The ES6 class declaration would be\n * `class BlurredCameraSource extends MediaSource.connectMixin()`. The mixin adds the connect and\n * disconnect methods for convenience. In the constructor, we can now create our camera source and\n * blur filter, connect them together, and simply expose the ouput property of the `blurFilter`\n * using `this.output = blurFilter.output`. Since the output lookup is recursive, we can call the\n * connect method of our `blurredCameraSource` directly, but the output port of the blurFilter will\n * in the end be what is actually connected.\n *\n * @class MediaNode\n */\nexport default class MediaNode {\n  constructor() {\n    this[inputs] = new Set()\n    this[outputs] = new Set()\n  }\n\n  toString() {\n    let name = this.constructor.name\n    let camelName\n    if (!name) {\n      camelName = '_mediaNode'\n    } else {\n      camelName = name[0].toLowerCase() + name.slice(1)\n    }\n\n    return `${camelName}{io=${this[inputs].size}/${this[outputs].size}}`\n  }\n\n  // Public methods\n\n  /**\n   * Connect two media nodes or ports together.

It does not provide\n  Byzantine fault tolerance, i.e. it assumes that all clients behave correctly.\n\n  Each conference client participates in the Raft consensus protocol, there are no\n  client-only nodes, like e.g. in etcd.\n  The primary purpose of the Raft implementation is to provide a unified view of who the\n  members of the conference are. Although it might prove to be useful for other types of\n  log replication at a later stage.\n\n  Raft supports controlled reconfiguration of the cluster members, which means that clients\n  can be added and removed as long as a majority of the current cluster can agree on the change.\n  For conferences we will sometimes see big changes in the number of participants. Adding\n  members is quite straight-forward to do with the baseline Raft implementation, even if\n  the new members make up the majority in the new configuration. Removing members is also\n  straight-forward as long as the removed clients stay connected until the new configuration\n  is in place.\n  The tricky bit is getting rid of disconnected clients. The cluster needs to be able to\n  reach a consensus that a client has been disconnected and can be removed. This will be\n  even more troublesome if a majority of the cluster disconnects, as it may cause the\n  new configuration and the entire cluster to get stuck in a bad state. Some mechanism\n  for handling netsplits by letting minorities break away from the cluster needs to be\n  implemented, as well as a mechanism for those clients to potentially rejoin the cluster\n  at a later point.\n\n  Alternative approaches:\n\n  The main alternative to using Raft that is being considered is that all peers would\n  simply broadcast the peers that they are connected to to all their connected peers.\n  This way every peer would be able to get a somewhat complete view of the members,\n  although it would fail to report peers that are more than two hops away. Consider\n  the below scenario where clients A, B, C and D only have 3 connections set up so far.\n\n    A <-> B <-> C <-> D\n\n  With the proposed solution, A would be unaware of D's existence, and vice versa.\n  This could be worked around by sending more information between the peers, with the\n  downside of added complexity and bandwidth usage.\n  Btw, Raft does not behave perfectly in the above scenario either, as A and D would take\n  turns in triggering new elections, but there will still be some log replication happening\n  and new connections should be set up soon enough.\n\n  Another issue is feedback for the clients, should A respond to requests from B? Raft solves\n  this with heartbeats and election timeouts.\n\n  In the end the main reason for choosing Raft is that it is an established algorithm that\n  is simple and easy to proove to be correct. Since raft needs to be extended a bit in order\n  to work for conferences, it is possible that this alternative is reveisited if the\n  modifications end up being too complex.\n  A downside of using Raft is that the log replication functionality is not used at the\n  moment, and it arguably what adds the most complexity to the algorithm. However, it is\n  quite likely that it will be used in the future for Smart Mesh or SFU.\n\n  Conference setup flow:\n\n  An important piece of functionality for the below flow is that it is possible to generate\n  a single offer that is valid for multiple peer connections, as long as all peer connections\n  are configured to use the same certificate. We will try to use this functionality initially\n  but may have to fall back to a more tranditional singaling approach if we run into trouble\n  with plugins and native mobile clients.\n\n  When joining a conference, send a JOIN message with the Raft ID and an offer SDP.\n  Now one of two things may happen, either there is already an existing conference and the\n  client will be added, or no one replies, and we wait. We likely want to repeat the JOIN\n  message every so often while waiting, in order to provide some fault tolerance.\n\n  When an existing conference sees a JOIN message a number of different things may happen\n  depending on the state of the conference. But this is the general algorithm:\n\n  (1) Upon receiving a JOIN message, every client adds the peer to a list of joining peers.\n  (2) Every client that is a leader (there may be multiple with different terms) will\n      send an answer to the joining peer. The joiner will set up a connection for each answer.\n  (3) Once connected the leader(s) will add the peer as a joining client, and will start\n      off by sending a snapshot of the current state. Once a reply from the snapshot request\n      has been received the leader will request a configuration change which includes the new\n      client.\n      The joining client will prioritize snapshots with the latest term, and ignored old ones.\n      Once the client has received a configuration where they are present and the configuration\n      has been committed, they will convert to a follower and be a full member of the cluster.\n      During this time, the joining client will communicate via the current p2p connections\n      to set up new connections towards the other members of the cluster.\n  (4) If there is a leadership change during the above process, the new leader will start over\n      at (2), that is if the client has not already joined the cluster. This is why every\n      client must keep track of JOIN messages.\n\n  Removing disconnected members:\n\n  The current plan is that each client will include the clients that it is not connected\n  to in the heartbeat responses. That will make it possible for the leader to detect when\n  no client is able to reach another client, and may then initiate a reconfiguration.\n\n  The trickier problem of handling netsplits where the conference is split into segments\n  is not yet solved. The current idea is to modify the voting algorithm and have vote\n  requests include connected peers. Hopefully it'll be possible to find a simple way to\n  simultaneously do an instant reconfiguration and leader election. This is probably\n  doable because the majority log consistency constraint can be ignored. When the segment\n  that has been spliced out rejoins the conference, the logs don't have to be consistent,\n  it'll be possible to just do a regular join via snapshots.\n\n  Updates:\n\n  25-03-2017, Client IDs:\n\n  The current implementation uses separate IDs for users and raft client, i.e. there is a 1-N mapping\n  of user to raft IDs. This is because if the raft client state is lost is it no longer safe to rejoin\n  the cluster using the same ID. Entries are committed based on the knowledge that clients are up to date,\n  and if a client loses it's state and then reconnects using the same ID, incorrect assumptions may be\n  made about what entries are actually committed.\n\n  A planned change will consolidate the IDs to only use user IDs for all clients. This makes the conference\n  implementation a lot simpler and easier to reason about. The reason this change can be made is the\n  introduction of the Joiner state and messages. Built into the raft algorithm is the guarantee that if\n  there exists a commit index N within the cluster, only clients that have at least N matching entries\n  can ever be elected leader. Since clients that are joining the cluster always do so through a leader,\n  it means that if a client reconnects, it will always receive a snapshot that restores at least N entries.\n  This means that any commit index determined by a leader will stay correct, even if a client loses it's\n  state and reconnects.\n\n  One caveat is that clients that lose their state MUST rejoin the cluster through the joiner mechanism.\n  If they simply rejoin as members then the above assumption does not hold and the implementation is not safe.\n\n  The crucial bit is that reconnecting members do not vote until they have received a snapshot. It is also\n  important that all snapshots that are sent contain all of the current log entries of the leader, otherwise\n  reconnecting members might receive a partial snapshot were they are member, and begin voting too early.\n\n  It is also possible that the disconnected client will be removed from the cluster before it rejoins. In\n  that case the original rule of the raft algorithm applies, since if it is possible to update the\n  configuration without the participation of the disconnected client, then the entries prior to the\n  reconfiguration can be considered committed, even without the disconnected client.\n\n  If the reconfiguration can not be committed due to lack of majority, the state machine will lock up until\n  either the member reconnects, or some other mechanism is used to recover. The change proposed above does\n  not solve this issue, but it likely does not make it more difficult to solve either.\n */\n\nclass WaitList {\n  constructor() {\n    this._entries = new Map()\n

and arraybuffers, which means that\n    applications need to handle serialization and type conversions.\n- They have somewhat arbitrary limits on message size, which varies depending\n    on the browsers involved. Large messages will be divided automatically, but there is\n    no obvious way for the sender or the receiver to detect that a message has been split.\n- If the application tries to send too much data too quickly the channel will\n    be closed, and the method of sending data at the correct pace varies\n    between WebRTC implementations.\n- Between Chrome and Firefox opening new data channel breaks after the first\n    renegotiation, so all channels have to be opened at the start of a connection.\n- Channels will silently stop working if data is not sent at regular intervals,\n    forcing the application to have heartbeats going in both directions.\n\nAll of these issues is too much complexity to leave to application developers, so\nwe provide an abstraction that aims to solve all of the above issues. The biggest\ndownside of this abstraction apart from the internal complexity it adds, is that we\nwill only support messaging in reliable and ordered mode.\n\nThe abstraction should provide the following:\n  - All channels opened at connection time, one main channel and a number or transfer channels.\n  - Transfer channels are used to transfer large (> 4096 byte) objects.\n  - Latency of small messages need to be kept low by separating them from large transfers.\n  - Large messages are transparently broken down and reconstructed.\n  - Support for sending object as JSON with support for serialization of some data types.\n  - Should at least support serialization of ArrayBuffers, typed arrays, Blobs.\n  - Message sending is throttled to maximize throughput without disconnecting channels.\n  - Application needs to be aware of the throttling to avoid back pressure.\n  - Replacing the RTCPeerConnection should result in a channel disconnect and reconnect.\n  - Channels are kept alive with heartbeats.\n  - Channel RTT is measured as part of the heartbeats.\n  - The API should be similar to the existing data channel API, but with the above features.\n\nHere's a diagram of the internal API design:\n\n    DataChannelMultiplexer ---> N x MuxedDataChannel\n      1 x |     1 x |\n          |         v\n          |   PriorityChannelSender // main channel sender\n          |     1 x |\n          |         v\n          |   RTCDataChannel // main channel\n          v\n    TransferChannelController ---> N x TransferItem, N x TransferAssembler\n      N x |\n          v\n    PriorityChannelSender // transfer channel senders\n      1 x |\n          v\n    RTCDataChannel // transfer channels\n\nThe DataChannelMultiplexer is responsible for the main channel messaging protocol\nand message serialization. It will split out large chunks of data and hand them\noff to the transfer manager.\n\nMuxedDataChannel is the public API to be used by the application. They work a lot\nlike normal WebRTC DataChannels, but with the improvements mentioned above.\n\nThe TransferChannelController is responsible for the transfer message protocol, but\nnot the data serialization.\n\nTransferItem and TransferAssembler are responsible for serializing and deserializing\ntransfers.\n\nPriorityChannelSender makes sure data is not sent too quickly, but also makes it\npossible to manage back-pressure to avoid large send queues and delays.\n\nRTCDataChannel are the regular built-in WebRTC DataChannels. They are set up at\nconnection time using pre-negotiated ids and always run in reliable and ordered mode.\n\nPausing:\n\nThe concept of pausing the datamux had to be added because of how the\nconference API works. A connection to a peer in a conference may be\nin the state where the connection is up, but the peer or oneself is\nnot a member of the raft configuration. We refer to that state as paused,\nsince we want to keep the connection around and resume it once we're both\na member of the raft configuration.\n\nIn the paused state, the RtcComponent API will report the peer as\ndisconnected, and it should not be possible to open channels to that peer.\nFurthermore, any channels that have been opened and messages that have\nbeen sent should all be cleared. Although we still want to keep the builtin\nchannels around.\n\nWe make one important assumption from the conference/raft abstraction layer\nin our implementation: pauses are always symmetrical, i.e. if we are\npaused, the peer will also be paused once, or we are disconnected.\n\nWith the above assumption the signaling becomes significantly simpler,\nsince it's enough that we close our own channels, and then send information\nabout what channels we closed to the peer.\n\nWe signal the channels we close by sending the next ID in our channel id\ncounter. Any channels below that ID are the ones we closed, except for\nbuiltin ones. The peer sets this as the new minimum channel ID, and if\nany messages are received for channels lower than that ID, they are ignored.\n\nClosing namespace:\n\nBeing able to close all channels in a channel had to be added because it's possible\nto detach an RtcComponent, which should lead to the channels being closed on both ends.\n\nWhen closing a namespace, all channels and pairing infos are removed and moved\nto the close state. This is only done locally, which means that the signaling in the\nattachment manager is relied upon for making sure the same channels are closed on the\nremote side.\n\nRemoving transfer channels:\n\nEarlier implementations used transfer channels for transmitting large chunks of data.\nIt was also possible to have multiple transfer channels, with the transfers spread\nout across them. However, testing showed that the fewer channels you use, the more\nreliable the connection will be. The most critical issue is that sent data is not\nproperly distributed across all channels. One channel would frequently be the only one\ntransmitting data, while the other ones waited, breaking pinging on the other channels.\nThis was especially frequent on low-throughput networks.\n\nThe pros of using transfer channels apart from hoping to be able to maintain a higher\nthroughput, was that the send queue implementation and protocol was simpler. Now we have\nto keep track of individual data chunks, since they will be interleaved with smaller messages.\n\n*/\n\n// Maximum size for high-priority messages.

FileShare} - Share files between all participants in a conference or call.\n * - {@link MediaBroadcaster} - Broadcast media to other users in a conference.\n * - {@link PeerMediaPipe} - Send and receive media from the peer in a call.\n * - {@link StreamPublisher} - Publish a stream to a stream relay with recording (requires recording service).\n * - {@link StreamSubscriber} - Subscribe to a relayed stream (requires recording service).\n *\n * Media API building blocks:\n * - {@link MediaNode} - Base class for all media nodes, which also contains some static utility methods.\n * - {@link MediaNodeInput} - An input port that receives streams for it's parent media node.\n * - {@link MediaNodeOutput} - An output port that forwards streams frmo it's parent media node.\n * - {@link MediaFilter} - Base class for nodes that receives and forwards a stream.\n * - {@link MediaSink} - Base class for nodes at the end of the chain that receive and renders a stream.\n * - {@link MediaSource} - Base class for source nodes that generate a stream.\n * - {@link ConcreteMediaSource} - Base class for a source that is backed by a single tangible stream.\n * - {@link WebAudioFilter} - Base class for WebAudio-based filter nodes.\n * - {@link WebAudioSource} - Base class for WebAudio-based source nodes.\n *\n * Build-in {@link MediaNode}s:\n * - {@link AudioBufferSource} - Plays audio buffers.\n *     Also provides utilities for decoding and loading audio buffers from files.\n * - {@link AudioMeter} - Analyses the volume of incoming audio and provides a raw, and low-pass values.\n * - {@link AudioMixer} - Mixes together audio from multiple streams into one output stream.\n * - {@link ChromeScreenSource} - Screen sharing in Chrome, you usually want to use {@link ScreenSource} instead.\n * - {@link DeviceSource} - Captures media from user microphones and cameras.\n * - {@link FirefoxScreenSource} - Screen sharing in Firefox, you usually want to use {@link ScreenSource} instead.\n * - {@link HtmlSink} - Renders the incoming audio and video to an HTMLMediaElement, i.e. `<audio>` or `<video>`.\n * - {@link MediaTee} - A container node that bundles together some common functionalities.\n *     Usually used as source node for remote streams.\n * - {@link MuteFilter} - Makes it possible to mute a media stream.\n * - {@link Passthrough} - Identity node that forwards streams, with optional logging.\n *     Used for inspection and smoothing out API surfaces.\n * - {@link Recorder} - Used for client-side recording of media streams.\n * - {@link ScreenSource} - Enables screen capture.\n * - {@link StreamMerger} - Merges the audio and video components from two incoming streams together into one stream.\n * - {@link StreamSink} - Quick access to a received MediaStream, used for testing and bridging APIs.\n * - {@link StreamSource} - Forwards a given MediaStream, used for testing and bridging APIs.\n * - {@link StreamSplitter} - Splits a stream into it's audio and video components.\n * - {@link UserMediaSource} - A low level node that requests user media, usually you\n *     want {@link DeviceSource} or {@link ScreenSource} instead.\n *\n * Error types:\n * - {@link AuthenticationError} - Authentication failed, or it is required to perform the requested action.\n * - {@link ChannelClosedError} - The operation failed because the channel was closed.\n * - {@link ChannelFailedError} - The channel failed due to a low-level error.\n * - {@link ChannelTimeoutError} - The channel operation timed out.\n * - {@link ConflictError} - The requested action would result in a conflict.\n * - {@link ConnectionFailedError} - Connection setup failed after signaling was completed.\n * - {@link ConnectionLostError} - A connection which was connected has now failed.\n * - {@link ConnectionSignalingError} - Error when trying to set up a connection.\n * - {@link FileTransferError} - Failure because of data corruption or a protocol error.\n * - {@link GuestAccessError} - Guests are not allowed to perform the requested action.\n * - {@link InternalServerError} - The server encountered an unexpected error.\n * - {@link InvalidAliasError} - The requested room alias is invalid.\n * - {@link InvalidUsernameError} - The requested username is invalid.\n * - {@link NotAllowedError} - The requested action is not allowed.\n * - {@link NotFoundError} - The requested resource could not be found.\n * - {@link TooLargeError} - The request body was too large.\n * - {@link TransferInterruptedError} - Failure because the connection was interrupted.\n *\n * @namespace cct\n */\n\nif (window.cordova && window.cordova.plugins && window.cordova.plugins.iosrtc) {\n  window.cordova.plugins.iosrtc.registerGlobals()\n}\n\nexport {default as
